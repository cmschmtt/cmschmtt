ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Caroline. I'm searching for the right next role after spending about five years in technical education. My B.S. is in Statistics, and I'm pursuing a Masters in Analytics (expected 2025.) Five years in technical education has given me a very broad skillset and made me an exceptional technical communicator -- I really shine walking through technical analyses and explaining methods and results. If you're interested in working together, my resume is available upon request -- shoot me an email at `cschmitt33` at `gatech` dot `edu`.

Here are some selected personal projects:
- [Association rule mining from semi-structured natural language data](https://github.com/cmschmtt/ds9-association-rules)
- [Predicting & understanding gas prices & transit demand in large markets](https://github.com/cmschmtt/gas-transit-forecasting)
